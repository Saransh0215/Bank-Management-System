# Bank-Management-System

The purpose of the bank management system is to simplify the management and maintenance of customer banking details and provide various banking services. This includes functions like creating bank accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, checking account balances, modifying account details, deleting bank accounts, and viewing past transactions.

The project will have an admin role with authoritative functionalities for managing bank accounts, while customers will have functionalities for money transactions and viewing their own account details. Customers will be able to view their transaction history, and the admin will have access to view all transactions by all customers.

The project will utilize data structures such as trees, linked lists, arrays, and vectors to efficiently store and manage data. The specific data structures used may vary based on project requirements during the development phase.
